    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media platforms like Twitter generate vast volumes of short texts that convey a wide spectrum of emotions. This project aims to build an automated system for emotion detection in these posts by fine-tuning transformer-based language models—such as BERT-base-multilingual-cased and XLM-RoBERTa-base—on two Twitter-sourced datasets. We will evaluate which model–dataset combination best captures the subtle nuances of emotional expression, addresses challenges like data imbalance and linguistic variability, and can serve as the foundation for future emotion-classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**\n",
    "- **XLM-RoBERTa (Cross-lingual Language Model)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used for training and evaluation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`TweetEval`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_eval): A benchmark suite of tasks built on English tweets.\n",
    "- [`SuperTweetEval`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/super_tweeteval): An extended multilingual version supporting more complex evaluation, including multi-label emotion classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** We have excluded the SEMEVAL-11 dataset from our experiments and are using only the two current Twitter-sourced datasets for the following reasons:\n",
    "> 1. **Richer annotations:** The two chosen datasets provide more granular emotion categories, clearer label definitions, and additional metadata columns compared to SEMEVAL-11.  \n",
    "> 2. **Availability:** SEMEVAL-11 is no longer hosted on the Hugging Face platform and cannot be accessed for fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to adapt these models to accurately classify a range of emotions datasest found in tweets, evaluating their strengths and challenges during fine-tuning. And see which model perfroms best with which result.\n",

    "This notebook focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tuning the BERT-based model (including `bert-base-uncased`, `twitter-roberta-base` and its variants) on both TweetEval and SuperTweetEval .\n",
    "- Preprocessing steps like emoji normalization and tokenization tailored for social media content.\n",
    "- Handling class imbalance and improving performance through parameter tuning.\n",
    "- Tracking training/validation metrics and analyzing results across epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `XLM_Finetune.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tuning the multilingual `XLM-RoBERTa` (and its variants) model on both TweetEval and SuperTweetEval.\n",
    "- Addressing challenges in cross-lingual emotion classification.\n",
    "- Analyzing model performance on non-English tweets.\n",
    "- Comparative metrics and evaluation of zero-shot or low-resource performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `Conclusion.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A summary of findings from both BERT and XLM fine-tuning experiments.\n",
    "- A comparative analysis of accuracy and F1 performance across both datasets.\n",
    "- Key challenges, trade-offs, and recommendations for future work (e.g., better handling of multi-label classification, cross-lingual transfer learning, or low-resource language support)."

    "* **Test F1 Score**: 0.7822\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite further hyperparameter tuning (increasing epochs, adjusting learning rate, batch size, and gradient accumulation steps), performance showed signs of overfitting after 8 epochs. Specifically, the validation loss began to rise, and accuracy and F1 scores plateaued or decreased. After training for 8 epochs, the results were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Test Accuracy**: 0.7701\n",
    "* **Test F1 Score**: 0.7124\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid overfitting and maintain a model that generalizes well, we decided to proceed with the initial 5-epoch model. This decision was based on the solid performance and better generalization observed during the earlier phase.\n",

Fine-tuning further with a lower learning rate seemed to reduce accuracy and hinder the model's performance, making the 5-epoch model the best choice for deployment.\n"

    "   - **Weight Decay (0.01)**: Applied for regularization to prevent overfitting, which is especially helpful on smaller datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Evaluation & Saving (`epoch`)**: Both evaluation and model checkpoint saving occur at the end of each epoch to monitor progress and preserve milestones.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - These values are selected to support consistent, stable fine-tuning on the emotion classification task while tracking and saving the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trainer Initialization**: The **`Trainer`** is instantiated with the model, training arguments, tokenized datasets (train/validation), tokenizer, and the custom `compute_metrics` function to automate training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**: The training is started via `trainer.train()`, which handles all optimization, evaluation, and checkpointing automatically based on the defined settings.\n"

    "### **Model Evaluation & Error Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first training, the model performed well, achieving an **accuracy of 0.827** and an **F1 score of 0.83**, which is a strong result for an initial run. To identify potential areas for improvement, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the dataset and model predictions. Here's what we discovered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class Imbalance** We observed that the dataset is imbalanced, with significantly more **Anger** examples than **Anticipation**, which likely biased the model during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Evidence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Training set:** Anger – 4,294 | Anticipation – 2,544\n",
    "    * **Validation set:** Anger – 571 | Anticipation – 315\n",
    "    * **Test set:** Anger – 2,158 | Anticipation – 1,101\n",
    "      This imbalance contributed to the model overpredicting **Anger** in several cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Confusion Matrix Analysis** The confusion matrix alsoe showed that the model still occasionally misclassifies **Anticipation** tweets as **Anger**, although the **recall for Anticipation improved** after applying class weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Evidence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **True Anticipation → Predicted Anger:** 166 instances\n",
    "    * **True Anger → Predicted Anticipation:** 397 instances\n",
    "    * **Anticipation recall** increased to **0.8492**, indicating improved sensitivity to the minority class compared to earlier (unweighted) runs.\n"

    "* **Test Accuracy:** 0.8272\n",
    "* **Weighted F1:** 0.8306\n",
    "\n",
    "While the initial results were strong, further analysis revealed a **class imbalance**—especially between **Anger** and **Anticipation**—which led to consistent misclassification of minority class examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyzed Class Distributions and Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Noted that Anger dominated the dataset\n",
    "   * Found over 160 Anticipation tweets misclassified as Anger\n",
    "   * Precision and recall for Anticipation were notably lower\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Introduced a Class-Weighted Loss Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Penalized the model more heavily for errors on underrepresented classes\n",
    "   * Used `CrossEntropyLoss` with manual weights (e.g., `1.5` for Anger, `5.0` for Anticipation)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Observed Signs of Overfitting, Yet Improved Test Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Training loss dropped sharply, while validation loss increased (suggesting overfitting)\n",
    "   * Despite this, **generalization improved on the test set**\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Test Accuracy:** 0.8450\n",
    "* **Weighted F1:** 0.8449\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a **1.78 percentage point gain** in accuracy and **1.43 points** in F1—confirming that **class-weighted training mitigated imbalance-driven bias**.

    "\n",
    "We evaluated the same `xlm-roberta-base` backbone on two emotion-classification benchmarks—**TweetEval** and **SuperTweetEval**—and observed the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Performance Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dataset            | Test Accuracy | Weighted F1 | Notes on Best Run                                           |\n",
    "| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **SuperTweetEval**      | 0.8450        | 0.8449      | After introducing class-weighted loss (5 epochs → 3 epochs) |\n",
    "| **TweetEval** | 0.8086        | 0.7822      | Best at 5 epochs; further tuning (8+ epochs) overfit        |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Comparative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Higher scores on TweetEval**\n",
    "  SuperTweetEval yielded a **1.78 pp** gain in accuracy and **1.43 pp** gain in F1 over its own unweighted baseline, outperforming TweetEval by **3.64 pp** in accuracy and **6.27 pp** in F1.\n",
    "* **Class Distribution & Difficulty**\n",
    "  TweetEval appears to have **more nuanced or noisier labels**, amplifying overfitting after extended training. In contrast, TweetEval’s clearer class definitions—and the corrective effect of class weighting—allowed the model to learn robust decision boundaries.\n",
    "* **Impact of Overfitting**\n",
    "  On TweetEval, validation loss rose sharply after 5 epochs, driving test metrics down by nearly **4.1 pp** in accuracy when training for 8 epochs. SuperTweetEval, however, benefited from the weighted loss despite some overfitting signs, because the weighting better aligned with its class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Why XLM Performed Best on SuperTweetEval\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Balanced Improvement via Class Weighting**\n",
    "   SuperTweetEval’s two-class imbalance (Anger vs Anticipation) was directly mitigated by weighted cross-entropy, boosting minority-class recall without catastrophically overfitting.\n",
    "2. **Simpler Label Space**\n",
    "   SuperTweetEval’s binary setup (vs. SuperTweetEval’s multi-class or more granular splits) allowed XLM-RoBERTa to learn discriminative patterns more cleanly.\n",
    "3. **Data Quality & Size**\n",
    "   Although both datasets are tweet-based, SuperTweetEval’s emotion subset is smaller but cleaner, whereas SuperTweetEval’s expanded annotations introduce label noise that the model struggles to generalize over.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Final Takeaway & Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deploy the SuperTweetEval model** (accuracy 0.845, F1 0.845) for immediate applications, as it demonstrates the strongest generalization.\n",
    "* **For TweetEval**, explore noise-robust techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Label smoothing** or **confidence-based filtering**\n",
    "  * **Data augmentation** (back-translation, paraphrasing)\n",
    "  * **Curriculum learning** starting from cleanest subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "By tailoring loss functions and leveraging dataset-specific insights, XLM-RoBERTa can be steered toward its best performance on each task—excelling on SuperTweetEval today, with clear paths to boost TweetEval tomorrow.\n"
